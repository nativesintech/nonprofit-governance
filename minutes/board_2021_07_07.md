    * Sister organization to the Centre for Indigenous Innovation and Technology to assist with training Indigenous individuals, providing internships, etc across the spectrum of technology careers.
    * We have some overlap in the desire to host infra on Indigenous lands rather than in colonial data centers. We want to have data sovereignty, and sovereignty over the hardware.
